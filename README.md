#  Agentic AI Learning Journal

Hi, I'm Iffat Maab — a BBIT student exploring the world of Agentic AI from the ground up. 
This journey began when I came across the "Panaversity Certified Agentic and Robotic AI Engineer" program (https://panaversity.org/flagship-program/courses).

What started off as a simple curiosity about Agentic AI has now evolved into a structured, step-by-step journey to understand the foundations of LLMs, LangChain, and autonomous agents. This repository is my way of learning in public—documenting not just what I learn, but how I learn it.
