#  Agentic AI Learning Journal

Hi, I'm Maab — a BBIT student exploring the world of Agentic AI from the ground up.  
This repository is a personal learning journal where I document everything I'm trying, understanding, and struggling with as I begin my journey into agent-based systems and LLMs.

I started with no prior experience in AI or professional coding, but I'm learning step by step — through experimentation, building small projects, and understanding the tools that power modern AI agents.


## Purpose of This Repo

- To track my learning process honestly
- To reflect on the concepts I explore, especially LangChain and LLMs
- To build a clear timeline of growth — from zero to wherever I go
- To keep everything in one place: notes, experiments, projects, and ideas

## Learning Focus (so far)

- What is Agentic AI?
- LLMs: ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek
- Calling APIs (Weather, LLM)
- Basic LangChain usage
- Async tasks in Python
- Simple agent experiments (e.g., LLM + API combo)

##  My Approach
I believe learning in public keeps me accountable and helps me grow with clarity.  
This repo is not meant to be perfect — it's meant to be real. It's my way of keeping track of what I learn, even when I'm unsure.
