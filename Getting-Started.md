#  Getting Started: Why I Chose to Learn Agentic AI

My journey into Agentic AI didn't start with coding or tools. It started with a question:

> "What makes an AI agent *agentic*? And how is it different from just using ChatGPT or Gemini?"

I had heard a lot about ChatGPT, LLMs, and even LangChain, but everything felt disconnected. I wanted to understand the deeper idea behind *Agentic AI* — not just use tools without knowing their purpose.

##  What I Explored First

Before even trying any code, I started exploring:

- **What is Agentic AI?**
- **Why do we need agents when LLMs already exist?**
- **What makes an agent 'autonomous' or 'interactive'?**
- **How is an agent different from ChatGPT, Gemini, or DeepSeek?**

These questions helped me realize that Agentic AI is not just about generating text — it's about creating systems that can reason, decide, and take actions using tools, memory, and logic.

##  What Came Next

Once I had some idea of what Agentic AI was, I started learning about the building blocks:
- LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek
- Tool usage (APIs, prompts, parsing data)
- LangChain as a framework to build agents

That’s when I created a small experiment: I connected a **weather API** with an LLM to simulate agent-like behavior — something that uses tools and generates helpful responses.

This repo is where I’ll continue documenting that learning — slowly, with honesty, and from a beginner’s eyes.
