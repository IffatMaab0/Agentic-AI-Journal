# Learning Python for Agentic AI

## Why I Started with Python

My journey into Agentic AI started with a big question:  
**"How can I spend my summer learning something powerful and future-focused?"**  
After reading about the *Panaversity Certified Agentic & Robotic AI Engineer* program, I realized Python is the core language powering most AI innovations — from ChatGPT to LangChain.

So, I made it my first stop.

## What I Covered in Python

I didn’t just want to learn syntax — I wanted to build logic and use Python the way it’s used in real AI projects.

Here’s what I focused on:

-  Basics: variables, data types, loops, functions, OOP  
-  Working with modules and libraries  
-  File I/O (essential for data processing)  
-  Virtual environments  
-  **AsyncIO** — the part that excited me the most


## How This Ties Into Agentic AI

Learning Python gave me the tools to:
- Understand how LLMs are wrapped and invoked
- Build web apps using Streamlit
- Prepare for using **LangChain**, where Python + async + agents work together

This foundation lets me **control the backend logic** behind my AI agents — not just prompt LLMs, but truly **build behavior**.
