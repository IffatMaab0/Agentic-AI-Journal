# Tools I’ve Used (Honestly)

This file is a record of the tools and platforms I’ve tried while exploring Agentic AI.  
As a beginner, I’m not focused on using every possible library — I care more about understanding the **concepts** and keeping things simple and resource-friendly.

## APIs

###  OpenWeatherMap API
- This was the first API I called using Python.
- It gave me real-time weather data based on city names.
- I used this as a tool in a very simple agent experiment.

---

## LLMs (Large Language Models)

### Groq (with OpenAI or Mixtral models)
- I used Groq’s hosted endpoints instead of OpenAI directly, since OpenAI's API is paid.
- Groq gave me access to powerful LLMs like GPT or Mixtral for free.
- I passed the weather data to Groq and got natural-language explanations in return.

## Libraries

## Python Libraries I Actually Used

- `requests` — for calling APIs
- `json` — for working with structured API responses
- `dotenv` — to keep my API keys safe
- `os` — just used a bit for managing environment variables

##  Tools I Haven’t Used *Yet* (But Plan To)

- Streamlit (I haven’t built any UI so far)
- AsyncIO (Haven’t used in Agentic AI projects yet)
- Vector DBs (Still learning what they are)

##  My Learning Philosophy

> As a beginner, I focus more on **understanding why things work** than using too many tools.  
> I prefer using free and beginner-friendly resources while slowly building my confidence in concepts like agents, LLM orchestration, and decision-making.

This list will grow naturally as I learn and try more things — but I want to keep it helpful to someone like me.
